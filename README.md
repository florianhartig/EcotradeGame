EcotradeGame
============

A multiplayer online game of a tradable permit market written in java. The game allows simulating the situation that landusers are subject to a incentive to conservation that depends on the land use in their surrounding, allowing to set incentives for or against fragmented land use. The game can be used for teaching or experimental economics.

I will move the code from svn to git in the next time. For the moment code and details are at http://www.ecotrade.ufz.de/ecotradegame.html
